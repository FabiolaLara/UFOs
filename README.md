# UFOs
+ Java Scrip
+ Visual Studio
+ Chrome
+ Live Server package


# Overview of Project:

  The purpose for this project is to retrieve information throught inputs given by a user where a table will be the format to enter the inputs to look for information about UFO's sightings. Using Java Script the information retrieved will be visualize in the same web page, the information will be display in order, having fields like: Date, City, State, Country, Shape (Of the UFO sighting), Duration and comments made. 


# Results: 

  Using the table for inputs by the user, a Date will be neccesary to search the information, the City, State, Country and Shape fields will complete the rest of the filter information for a more complete data retrieved.
  
  The way this information is search is very smart due the table request specific data to the user to filter information from the internet, offering a huge advantage beacuse people donÂ´t have to develop web pages from zero, Java offers the posibility to code a little bit and get a vast information data.
  
    The nex image shows how the index file is displayed once we just click on it.

This image shows the fields that will be filled by the user, there is some information that appear automatically i the text box in order the user knows what kind of information must be typed.

# Summary: 

  One of the drawback issues using Java is that the basic information to code to retrieve data from the internet is considerably extensive, and you need to be very carefully while doing it, there must be a structure in order to not to be lost or miss a detail. On the other hand it is very efficient once we have the design of the web page, using this type of programs the appliance is huge, having this information retrieved for the internet, we could make some analysis about interest from people, for example, asking clients whay they like or dislike for specific information that exist in the Internet, avoiding us to invent the black thread. Another thing we could make developing this file is to save in a data base the information typed or seraching by the user either in this challenge or scraping for any different topic so we could make maybe statiscall analysis in order to see users interests.
